                                <h1>SAFARI</h1>
                    <P>
                        Sri Lanka has become one of the world's most popular safari destinations due to its abundance of national parks, diverse wildlife – including elephants and leopards – and long-term conservation plan.
                        Sri Lanka, a tear-shaped island in the Indian Ocean, has one of the world's highest rates of biological endemism, with 16 percent of its fauna and 23% of its flora being unique to the nation.<br><br>
                        More than 400 kinds of birds live there, including elephants, leopards, sloth bears, blue whales, and sperm whales. It's also one of the few sites in the world where you can go on a land safari and see whales on the same day.
                        Sri Lanka's Department of Wildlife Conservation manages 26 state-owned national parks covering 5,734 square kilometers (2,214 square miles). Culture Trip traverses the length and breadth of Sri Lanka in pursuit of the ultimate safari.

                                <h1>WHALE WATCHING</h1>
                    <P style="font-size: 18px;">
                        You may witness a range of stunning animals while on vacation in Sri Lanka, including huge whales, which are 
                        arguably the most majestic of them all. As they travel in pursuit of higher temperatures, these lovely marine critters will be seen in 
                        the vivid blue seas off the coast of Trincomalee.<br><br>
                        Sri Lanka is home to not one, but two massive whale species. The sperm whale, the world's biggest living toothed predator, may grow to reach 
                        more than 20 meters long. Other whale species found in Sri Lankan waters, such as the enormous blue whale, however, dwarf this colossus. With 
                        lengths of more than 25 meters, this baleen whale is the largest known living creature on the world! Both of these species may be found on the 
                        island's east coast from May to October. July has proven to be a very good month for seeing blue whales. Seeing these creatures breach and 
                        flaunt their big tail flukes in the air may be a thrilling experience. All of this, of course, will be seen from the comfort and safety of 
                        your tour boat.

                    Anyone visiting Trincomalee should pay a visit to the famous Pigeon Island. Some of Sri Lanka's best coral 
                    reefs and a profusion of fascinating marine life may be found in this stunning national park. Simply said, a trip here will make a lasting effect on you. 
                    Pigeon Island is about a kilometer off the shore of Nilaveli Beach, which is a beautiful location in its own right. The islands of Big Pigeon and 
                    Little Pigeon are really two separate islands. Both islands are named for the massive flocks of rock pigeons that nest among the islands' rough cliffs.

                    <P>
                        Hikkaduwa is famed for its picturesque coastline and vibrant corals, and it is home to some 
                        of Sri Lanka's and Asia's best coral reefs. Massive stretches of limestone that run down the coast are excellent for cultivating a 
                        spectacular variety of coral. Additionally, the surrounding sea is quite shallow, making it a fantastic snorkeling location.
                        The region surrounding the Hikkaduwa Coral Reef was classified as a national park in 2002, making it one of only three marine national 
                        parks in Sri Lanka. This was done to protect the adjacent reef, which was slowly degrading due to overexposure.
